USER INSTRUCTIONS: Exercise 1: 

Write a program that keeps a secret unless the correct password "dragon" is given.
Example Output 1
What's the password? dragon
Correct! My secret is: I am Batman.
Example Output 2
What's the password? Schlumbumb
Incorrect Password! My secret is still safe ...

Exercise 2: class GradeBot
Write a program that will help the user calculate their grade and percent on a test.
1. Ask the user what the test was out of
2. Ask the user for their test mark
3. Calculate and print their percentage grade as an integer (ie: 87%).
4. Figure out what letter grade that mark is, and write a message to the user to congratulate
them on a job well done or encourage them to do better next time.
5. Find a way to prevent the user from crashing the program if they make the test out of zero, and
deal with negative percentages and percentages greater than 100.

Exercise 3: class Magic8Ball
Using Math.Random, simulate a Magic 8 Ball. The user should be able to ask a yes or no question,
and the Magic 8 Ball will return a random vague answer. You should have 20 possible answers that
can be returned.
• Here is an example of a Magic 8 Ball simulator.
• Here is a list of the official Magic 8 Ball answers (although you are welcome to make up your
own).
